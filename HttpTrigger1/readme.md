# HttpTrigger - C<span>#</span>

The `HttpTrigger` makes it incredibly easy to have your functions executed via an HTTP call to your function.

## How it works

When you call the function, be sure you checkout which security rules you apply. If you're using an apikey, you'll need to include that in your request.
